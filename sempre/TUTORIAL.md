# SEMPRE: Semantic Parsing with Execution

In this tutorial, we will provide a brief tour of SEMPRE by constructing a
semantic parser to understand a toy subset of natural language.  Concretely,
the system will have the following behavior:

- Input: *What is three plus four?*
- Output: 7

In semantic parsing, *natural language utterances* are mapped into *logical
forms* (think programs), which are executed to produce some *denotation* (think
return value).

## Configuration

To download all the dependencies for the system, run:

    ./download-dependencies core

To compile the system, run:

    make

To run the system, run:

    java -Xmx3g -cp classes:lib/* edu.stanford.nlp.sempre.Main -executor JavaExecutor -interactive

This will put you in an interactive prompt where you can develop a system and
parse utterances into tiny Java programs.  Note: you might find it convenient
to use `rlwrap` to get readline support.

## Formulas and denotations

A logical form (`Formula`) is a hierarchical expression.  For example, we have
primitive logical forms:

    (boolean 4)
    (number 3)
    (string hello)
    (date 2013 7 28)

Logical forms can be constructed recursively using `call`, which takes a
function name followed by arguments:

    (call + (number 3) (number 4))
    (call java.lang.Math.cos (number 0))
    (call .indexOf (string "what is this?") (string is))
    (call .substring (string "what is this?") (number 5) (number 7))
    (call if (call < (number 3) (number 4)) (string yes) (string no))

Note the logical form is very explicitly typed.  You would probably not want to
program directly in this language, but that is not the point; we will generate
these logical forms automatically from natural language.

We can execute these logical forms by typing into the interactive prompt:

    (execute (call + (number 3) (number 4)))

This should print out `(number 7)`, which we refer to as the *denotation* of
the logical form.  Try to execute the other logical forms and see what you get.

### Lambda expressions

So far, we have been representing monolithic logical forms.  When we start
doing parsing, it will be convenient to be able to refer to logical forms with
some of its parts abstracted out.  For example, the following logical form
represents a function that takes a number and returns its square:

    (lambda x (call * (var x) (var x)))

We apply a lambda expression in the usual LISP way:

    ((lambda x (call * (var x) (var x))) (number 3))

Executing this expression should yield `(number 9)`.

Technical note: these lambda expressions are just doing macro substitution, not
actually representing higher-order functions; since there are no side effects
here, there is no difference.

This concludes the section on logical forms and denotations.  We have presented
one system of logical forms, which are executed using the `JavaExecutor`.  The
system is general in that it supports other types of logical forms, for
example, those which encode SPARQL database queries.

## Parsing

Having established the nature of logical forms and their denotations, let us
turn to the problem of mapping a natural language utterance into a logical
form.  We will proceed by defining a *grammar*, which is a set of rules
which specify how to perform this mapping piece by piece.

We can add a rule to the grammar by entering the following:

    (rule $ROOT (three) (ConstantFn (number 3)))

Now just type in:

    three

The parser should print out (among other information) a line that shows that
the utterance was interpreted sucessfully as:

    (derivation (formula (number 3.0)) (value (number 3.0)) (type fb:type.number))

Note: The first time you parse an utterance will be slower since some models need to be uploaded

You should get no results if you type in:

    four

This is your first grammar with a single trivial rule.  The rule says that if
we see *three* in the natural language, we can construct a *Derivation* (the
one shown above) with

1. category `$ROOT`, and
2. logical form `(number 3)`.

Let us create a more general rule:

    (rule $ROOT ($PHRASE) (NumberFn))

This rule says match any phrase (sequence of tokens), pass it to a *semantic function* called
`NumberFn`, which will transform it into a new derivation.

Now the system can interpret general numbers.  Try typing in:

    twenty five million

The result shold be `(number 2.5E7)`.  If you type in `three`, you should get
two derivations that yield the same answer, one coming from each rule.

So far, we have only parsed utterances using one rule, but the true power of
these grammars come from combining multiple rules.  Copy and paste in the
following rules:

    (rule $Expr ($PHRASE) (NumberFn))
    (rule $Operator (plus) (ConstantFn (lambda y (lambda x (call + (var x) (var y)))) (-> fb:type.number (-> fb:type.number fb:type.number))))
    (rule $Operator (times) (ConstantFn (lambda y (lambda x (call * (var x) (var y)))) (-> fb:type.number (-> fb:type.number fb:type.number))))
    (rule $Partial ($Operator $Expr) (JoinFn forward))
    (rule $Expr ($Expr $Partial) (JoinFn backward))
    (rule $ROOT ((what optional) (is optional) $Expr (? optional)) (IdentityFn))

Now try typing in:

    What is three plus four?

The output should be

    (number 7)

We can parse longer sentences.  Type in:

    What is three plus four times two?

There should be two derivations, yielding `(number 14)` and `(number 11)`,
corresponding to either combining *three plus four* first or *four times two*
first.  Note that this is expected because we have not encoded any order of
operations here.

Let us examine more formally how grammars work in general.  Each rule has the
following form:

    (rule |target| (|source_1| ... |source_k|) |semantics|)

Where |target|, |source_1|, ... |source_k| are either tokens (e.g., *three*)
or syntactic categories (all categories start with `$` by convention), and
|semantics| specifies a semantic function (for example, `ConstantFn`, which
always returns a fixed value, or `IdentityFn`, which returns the input, etc.)

Derivations are built recursively: for each span (subsequence of the tokens in
the utterance), we construct a set of Derivations recursively.  We can apply a
rule if there is some segmentation of that sequence into spans $s_1, \dots,
s_k$ and a derivation $d_i$ for each span $s_i$ matching |source_i|.  In
this case, we pass the list of derivations as input into the semantic function.
The output is a set of derivations (possibly zero if we want the semantic
function to act as a filter).

The first rule is a familiar one that just parses numbers such as `three
million` into the category `$Expr`:

    (rule $Expr ($PHRASE) (NumberFn))

The next two map the tokens *plus* and *times* to a static logical form
(returned by `ConstantFn`):

    (rule $Operator (plus) (ConstantFn (lambda y (lambda x (call + (var x) (var y)))) (-> fb:type.number (-> fb:type.number fb:type.number))))
    (rule $Operator (times) (ConstantFn (lambda y (lambda x (call * (var x) (var y)))) (-> fb:type.number (-> fb:type.number fb:type.number))))

Here, the logical form is

    (lambda y (lambda x (call + (var x) (var y))))

which represents a curried function that takes `y` and `x` and returns calls
`+` on the values.  The type of this entry is:

    (-> fb:type.number (-> fb:type.number fb:type.number))

The type is used in parsing to prevent bad derivations from being combined
spuriously.

The next two rules are the main composition rules:

    (rule $Partial ($Operator $Expr) (JoinFn forward))
    (rule $Expr ($Expr $Partial) (JoinFn backward))

The semantic function `(JoinFn forward)` takes two a lambda term `$Operator`
and an argument `$Expr` and returns a new derivation by forward application:

    Input $Operator: (lambda y (lambda x (call + (var x) (var y))))
    Input $Expr: (number 4)
    Output $Partial: (lambda x (call + (var x) (number 4)))

The semantic function `(Join backward)` takes an argument `$Expr` and a lambda
term `$Partial` and returns a new derivation by backward application:

    Input $Expr: (number 3)
    Input $Partial: (lambda x (call + (var x) (number 4)))
    Output $Expr: (call + (number 3) (number 4))

    (rule $ROOT ((what optional) (is optional) $Expr (? optional)) (IdentityFn))

We allow some RHS elements to be optional, so that we could have typed in
`three plus four` or `three plus four?`.  `IdentityFn` simply takes the logical
form corresponding to `$Expr` and passes it up.

Note that some categories are special:

- $TOKEN (base case): matches any single token.
- $PHRASE (base case): matches any span of tokens.
- $ROOT (final output): any Derivation produced for $ROOT spanning the entire
  utterance is returned as a Derivation for the utterance.

We also have lemmatized versions of the base cases: the base derivations
corresponding to $LEMMA_TOKEN and $LEMMA_PHRASE have denotations which are the
the lemmatized versions of the tokens underneath (for example $TOKEN would
yield *cows*, while $LEMMA_TOKEN would yield *cow*).  Stanford CoreNLP is
required for lemmatization.

## Learning

So far, we have used the grammar to generate a set of derivations given an
utterance.  In general, this set is huge and we need a way to rank the
derivations.  Our strategy is to provide the system with training examples,
from which the system can learn a model that places a distribution over
derivations given utterances.

To enable learning in the interactive prompt, do the following (we could have
also passed these in as command-line arguments, e.g.,
`-Master.onlineLearnExamples true -FeatureExtractor.featureDomains rule`):

    (set Master.onlineLearnExamples true)
    (set FeatureExtractor.featureDomains rule)

The first statement turns on online learning updates (this is only necessary
for the interactive prompt).  The second statement adds features that keep
track of which rules we are using.

As a simple example, imagine that a priori, we do not know what the word *and*
means: it could be either plus or times.  Let us add two rules to capture the
two possibilities:

    (rule $Operator (and) (ConstantFn (lambda y (lambda x (call + (var x) (var y)))) (-> fb:type.number (-> fb:type.number fb:type.number))))
    (rule $Operator (and) (ConstantFn (lambda y (lambda x (call * (var x) (var y)))) (-> fb:type.number (-> fb:type.number fb:type.number))))

Now type in

    three and four

There should be two derivations each with probability 0.5:

    (derivation (formula (((lambda y (lambda x (call + (var x) (var y)))) (number 4.0)) (number 3.0))) (value (number 7.0)) (type fb:type.number)) [score=0, prob=0.500]
    (derivation (formula (((lambda y (lambda x (call * (var x) (var y)))) (number 4.0)) (number 3.0))) (value (number 12.0)) (type fb:type.number)) [score=0, prob=0.500]

You will also see the features that are active for the first derivation.  For
example, the following feature represents the fact that one of the rules we
just added is active:

    [ rule :: $Operator -> and (ConstantFn (lambda y (lambda x (call + (var x) (var y)))) (-> fb:type.number (-> fb:type.number fb:type.number))) ]      0 = 1 * 0

So far all the features have weight zero, so all the scores (dot products
between feature vector and weight vector) are also zero.

We can add a training example which says that the utterance should map to the first derivation:

    (accept 0)

This should perform a stochastic gradient update of the parameters.  Now type in:

    three and four

The first derivation should have much higher probability (around 0.88).  To see
the new parameters, type in:

    (params)

This concludes the basics of logical forms, denotations, grammars, features,
and learning.  In practice, much of these operations can be done offline by
putting the grammar rules in a file (`data/tutorial.grammar`) and the examples
in another file (`data/tutorial.examples.json).  Then you can one run command
to perform what we just did:

    java -cp classes:lib/* edu.stanford.nlp.sempre.Main -executor JavaExecutor -Grammar.inPaths data/tutorial.grammar -Dataset.inPaths train:data/tutorial.examples.json -readLispTreeFormat false -trainFrac 0.5 -devFrac 0.5 -maxTrainIters 2 -featureDomains rule -execDir tutorial.out

This will create a directory `tutorial.out` which records all the information
associated with this run.

## Lambda calculus and SPARQL

So far, we have worked with `JavaExecutor` as the engine that maps logical
forms to denotations by executing Java code.  A major application of semantic
parsing is where the logical forms are database queries.  In this section, we
will look at querying graph databases.

A graph database (e.g., Freebase) stores information about entities
and their properties; concretely, it is just a set of triples $(s, p, o)$,
where $s$ and $o$ are entities and $p$ is a property.  For example:

    fb:en.barack_obama fb:place_of_birth fb:en.honolulu

is one triple.  If we think of the entities as nodes in a directed graph, the
each triple is a directed edge between two nodes labeled with the property.

See `data/tutorial.ttl` for an example of a tiny subset of the Freebase graph
pertaining to geography about California.

We will use Virtuoso to provide the backend for querying this data.  Make sure
you have Virtuoso downloaded and compiled (see QUICKSTART.md for instructions).

Start the server:

    scripts/virtuoso start tutorial.vdb 3001

Add the small graph to the database:

    scripts/virtuoso add data/tutorial.ttl 3001

Aside: if you want to work with a larger database:

    ./download-dependencies geofreebase_ttl    # Subset of Freebase for geography in .ttl format
    ./download-dependencies geofreebase_vdb    # Virtuoso index for subset of Freebase for geography
    ./download-dependencies fullfreebase_ttl   # All of Freebase in .ttl format (BIG FILE)
    ./download-dependencies fullfreebase_vdb   # Virtuoso index for all of Freebase (BIG FILE)

Then, just replace `tutorial.vdb` with the appropriate `lib/freebase/??.exec/vdb` path.

Now we are ready to make some queries.  Start up the interactive prompt, now with the `SparqlExecutor`:

    java -cp classes:lib/* edu.stanford.nlp.sempre.Main -executor SparqlExecutor -endpointUrl http://localhost:3001/sparql -interactive

SPARQL is a language for querying these graphs, but it will be convenient to
use a language more tailored for semantic parsing which is based on a mix
between lambda calculus, description logic, and dependency-based compositional
semantics.  The simplest formula is a single entity:

    fb:en.california

To execute this query, simply type the following into the interactive prompt:

    (execute fb:en.california)

This should return:

    (list (name fb:en.california California))

The result is a list containing the single entity.  Here, `fb:en.california` is
the canonical Freebase ID (always beginning with the prefix `fb:`) and
`California` is the name (look at `data/tutorial.ttl` to see where this comes
from).

Let us try a more complex query which will fetch all the cities (in the database);

    (execute (fb:type.object.type fb:location.citytown))

This should return the three cities, Seattle, San Francisco, and Los Angeles.
We can restrict to *cities in California*:

    (execute (and (fb:type.object.type fb:location.citytown) (fb:location.location.containedby fb:en.california)))

This should return the two cities satisfying the restriction: San Francisco and Los Angeles.

We can count the number of cities (should return 3):

    (execute (count (fb:type.object.type fb:location.citytown)))

We can also get the city with the largest area:

    (execute (argmax 1 1 (fb:type.object.type fb:location.citytown) fb:location.location.area))

Now let us take a closer look at what is going on with these logical forms
under the hood.  We are using a logical language called lambda-DCS.

Here are the following types of logical forms:

1. Primitive (e.g., `fb:en.seattle`): denotes a set containing that single entity.
1. Intersection `(and |u1| |u2|)`: denotes the intersection of the sets denoted
   by unary logical forms `u1` and `u2`.
1. Join `(|b| |u|)`: denotes the set of $x$ which are connected to some $y$ via
   a binary $b$ and $y$ is in the set denoted by unary $u$.
1. Count `(count |u|)`: denotes the set containing the cardinality of the set denoted by `u`.
1. Superlative `(argmax |rank| |count| |u| |b|)`: sort the elements of `z` by decreasing `b`
   and return `count` elements starting at offset `rank` (1-based).
1. Mu abstraction `(mark (var |v|) |u|)`: same as the unary |u| denoting
   entities |x|, with the exception that |x| must be equal to all occurrences
   of the variable |v| in |u|.
2. Lambda abstraction `(lambda (var |v|) |u|)`: produces a binary (x,y) where
   `x` is in the set denoted by `u` and `y` is the value taken on by variable
   `v`.

See `SparqlExecutorTest.java` for examples.

### Parsing

So far, we have described the denotations of logical forms for querying a graph
database.  Now we focus on parsing natural language utterances into these logical forms.

The core challenge is at the leixcal level: mapping natural language phrases to
logical predicates.  To do this, we add a rule which relies on `LexiconFn`,
which uses a Lucene index to perform the lookup:

    (rule $Entity ($PHRASE) (LexiconFn entity allowInexact))  # e.g., California
    (rule $Unary ($PHRASE) (LexiconFn unary))                 # e.g., cities
    (rule $Binary ($PHRASE) (LexiconFn binary))               # e.g., in
    (rule $ROOT ($Entity) (IdentityFn))

Type the following into the prompt:

    Barack Obama

This should return a long list of candidate entities which approximately match the input.

Now for some compositionality, add the following rules, which will take two
logical forms and either perform an intersection or a join:

    (rule $Set ($Unary $PartialSet) (MergeFn and))
    (rule $PartialSet ($Binary $Entity) (JoinFn binary,unary unaryCanBeArg1))

This allows us to type in:

    cities in California

Currently, there are too many possibilities.

For an example of a more complex grammar, look at `data/emnlp2013.grammar`.

## Exercises

1. Convert the following natural language utterances into lambda-DCS logical forms:

    `city with the largest area`

    `states bordering Oregon and Washington`

    `top 5 cities by area`

    `countries whose capitals have area at least 500 squared kilometers`

    `second tallest mountain in Europe`

    `country with the most number of rivers`

You should familiarize yourself with the [Freebase schema](http://www.freebase.com/schema) to see which
predicates to use.

Execute these logical forms on the `geofreebase` subset to verify your answers.

2. Write a grammar that can parse the above utterances into a set of candidates
containing the true logical form you annotated above.  Train a model (remember
to add features) so that the correct logical forms appear at the top of the
candidate list.

## Background reading

So far this tutorial has provided a very operational view of semantic parsing
based on SEMPRE.  The following references provide a much broader look at
the area of semantic parsing and the linguistic and statistical foundations.

* **Natural language semantics**: The question of how to represent natural
  language utterances using logical forms has been well-studied in linguistics
  under formal (or compositional) semantics.  Start with the
  [CS224U course notes from Stanford](http://www.stanford.edu/class/cs224u/readings/cl-semantics-new.pdf)
  and
  [an introduction by Lappin](http://web.mit.edu/cilene/www/sema/aula1/15.pdf).
  You should take away from this an appreciation for the various phenomena in
  natural language.

* **Log-linear models**: Our semantic parser is based on log-linear models,
which is a very important tool in machine learning and statistical natural
language processing.  Start with [a tutorial by Michael
Collins](http://www.cs.columbia.edu/~mcollins/loglinear.pdf), which is geared towards applications
in NLP.

* **Semantic parsing**: finally, putting the linguistic insights from formal semantics
and the computational and statistical tools from machine learning, we get
semantic parsing.  There has been a lot of work on semantic parsing.

Zettlemoyer](http://yoavartzi.com/pub/afz-tutorial.acl.2013.pdf),
which focuses on how to build semantic parsers using Combinatory Categorical Grammar (CCG).
Our [EMNLP 2013
